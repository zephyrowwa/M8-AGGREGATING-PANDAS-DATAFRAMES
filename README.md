# M8-Aggregating-Pandas-DataFrames
MODULE 8 CPE22S3 CPE311


- learned how to store a Pandas DataFrame in a SQLite database, which allows you to manage the data later.
- practiced using Data Manipulation Language (DML) to change and organize the data within the database.
- use Pandas' aggregate functions to perform multiple calculations on a given data at once.
  - used to find the mean, minimum, and maximum values simultaneously.
- grouping related data points together using the groupby function and then applying aggregations to these groups.
  - helps easily summarize and analyze data based on categories.
- learned different ways to work with DataFrames containing time-based information, specifically when the date column includes hours. This is different from previous exercises where we only dates were used.
- between_time and at_time to accurately select and analyze data based on specific time ranges.

learned how to store, manipulate, and analyze data, including data with time-based information.
